Here are some feature ideas that could enhance the social music discovery experience:

1. Music Taste Matching
- Optional profile creation where users list favorite genres/artists
- "Music compatibility score" shown when matched with someone
- Option to match with people who have similar OR very different taste to discover new genres

2. Virtual Listening Room
- A shared space where both users can listen to songs in sync
- Live reactions/emojis while listening
- Real-time timestamp indicator showing both users are at the same point in the song

3. Playlist Creation
- Ability to collaboratively build playlists during your chat
- Option to save and export these to Spotify
- "Session playlist" that automatically saves songs shared during your conversation

4. Ice Breakers & Prompts
- "Share a song that..." prompts (made you cry, reminds you of childhood, etc.)
- Musical hot takes/opinions to discuss
- "Guess the genre/year" games you could play with matches

5. Profile Features
- Music stats showing top genres/artists
- Option to display current "song of the day"
- Musical milestones ("Has shared 100 songs", "Genre Explorer")
- Option to add friends and reconnect with good matches later

6. Content Features
- Ability to share short voice notes explaining why you love a song
- Quick snippets of you playing instruments (if you're a musician)
- Song recommendation categories (e.g., "For studying", "Party tracks", "Hidden gems")

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features? I can also think about more specific implementation details or additional ideas focused on particular aspects of the platform.
